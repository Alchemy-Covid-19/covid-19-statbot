## Conflict Plan
* @here in Slack channel
* Everyone stops and regroups
* Differing opinions about how to proceed
  * Majority rules
  * If strong feelings, outside opinion (TA, Ryan)
## Communication Plan
* Morning standup
  * 10 minute check-in
  * Project progress
  * Each individual's comfort level and engagement
* Afternoon check-in as needed

* After hours communication is fine but not required
* If working after hours, must communicate with whole group about what working on; cannot merge
* Communication about which files people are working in to avoid merge conflicts
  * Jira for tracking tickets
  * Card numbers for branch names
* Github 
  * Two people review PR
    * Slack status?
  * Maker of PR must be the one to merge
